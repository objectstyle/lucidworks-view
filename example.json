Does Eagle provide any scripts to facilitate the sanitising of the database? What is sensitive data? Eagle classes sensitive data as anything that has identification attributes; typically names, account codes, legal names, contacts, phone numbers and email addresses. As part of Eagle's data policy this information cannot be sent to Eagle and must be scrubbed first. In addition, Eagle cannot totally predict what data has been populated and in which field, as a result it is the client's reponsibility to ensure that all of the fields have been cleaned prior to shipping the database. The key tables and fields (but Eagle must stress this is by no means limited to) are that typical contain sensitive data and are detailed in the file Sensitive Fields. TXT Script & Stored Procedure This is a stored procedure that will allow you to sanitize sensitive data held in your database. This information is typically (but by no means limited) to the RULES database, this will be split across a number of tables; typically entity and client tables - you should check with your Project Manager to ensure that you have all of the fields that could contain sensitive data. This article also includes the old mechanism (5794_CleanUp.SQL) which is a simple script identifying the key tables and fields. Where applicable you should use the stored procedure and maintain your own copy of the procedure. How do I scrub the data? Before you execute this script you must fully understand the implications and the process as laid out in the Technical Best Practices document. This script is non-supportable by Eagle other than to ensure that the data is converted in a persistent manner, it is the responsibility of the client to ensure that a backup has been completed and that the correct tables are updated. Is there a test I can run prior to understand the process? There is, depending on your DBMS this is detailed below: MS SQL Server Test Log into Query Analyzer, apply the stored procedure SANITIZE_SP to the appropriate database and run the following: use pace_master go drop table checkscript go create table checkscript(a int,b varchar(50),c varchar(50)) go insert into checkscript values (1,'Hello','Hello world') go select * from checkscript go exec SANITIZE_SP 'PACE_MASTER','checkscript','B','Goodbye','A'; go select * from checkscript go You will notice that the column \"b\" originally \"Hello\" now reads 1 Goodbye. The procedure prefixes the idenfier column (in this case specificed as \"A\") to the value to ensure uniqueness - as the majority of the tables in question have some sort of uniqueness on them. Oracle Log into SQL*Plus, apply the stored procedure SANITIZE_SP to the appropriate database and run the following as the PACE_MASTERDBO user: drop table checkscript; create table checkscript(a int,b varchar(50),c varchar2(50)); insert into checkscript values (1,'Hello','Hello world'); commit; select * from checkscript; exec SANITIZE_SP 'PACE_MASTERDBO','checkscript','B','Goodbye','A'; select * from checkscript; You will notice that the column \"b\" originally \"Hello\" now reads 1 Goodbye.
